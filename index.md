# What is Power Pods?
Power pods is an app implementation of a transformative justice community building tool to serve as an alternative to policing. The main function of the app is for users to digitally organize their support system as a tool to use during violent, harmful, and abusive situations whether they are a survivor, bystander, or the person that did the harm. 
                                    
Power pods provides you tools to help you build your community

The word "pod" refers to a specific term in transformative justice. It describes the kind of relationship between people who would reach out to each other for      support during and to prevent violent, harmful, and abusive experiences (per Bay Area Transformative Collective). Power pods is an application of this concept into a social media framework. To learn more about pods, [click here](https://batjc.wordpress.com/pods-and-pod-mapping-worksheet/)
