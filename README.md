## Accountability Pods
# Short Description
Accountability pods is an app implementation of a transformative justice community building tool to serve as an alternative to policing. The main function of the app is for users to digitally organize their support system as a tool to use during violent, harmful, and abusive situations whether they are a survivor, bystander, or the person causing harm.

In terms of features, the app has the following:

1. Two types of users: individuals and organizations
	* Individual users have their own profiles where they can list conflict solving skills or materials they have access to. For example, if you have a working car, you could add this to the profile so other people in your network can contact you if they need an emergency ride or a jump, etc.
	* Organizations can create their own profiles or profiles can be made directly by us using information available online. For example, the SC Harm Reduction Coalition provides free narcan to community members to treat overdoses. Their profile page would include information about how to contact the organization, as well as some blurbs about the kind of work the organization does.

2. The main functionality is connecting with other users and searching through 'pods.'
	* By establishing connections with other users and organizations, the user will form a social network of accountability pods

Our target platform for the application is an IOS app using Swift, Xcode, and Firebase. You can see more detailed information about the project on the [Architecture](https://github.com/SCCapstone/Accountability-Pods/wiki/Architecture-Milestone) page of the wiki.
